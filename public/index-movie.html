<h1>This is my list of favourite Woody Allen movies:</h1>
<hr />

    <h2>1. Midnight in Paris</h2>
    
    <p>What’s not to like about Paris, time travel, Hemingway, Picasso, and the Lost Generation</p>
    
    <h2>2. Manhattan</h2>
    
    <p>Worth watching just for the opening sequence of fireworks set to Gershwin’s music and Mariel Hemingway</p>
    
    <h2>3. Play it Again Sam</h2>
    
    <p>A film adaptation of a hit Broadway play with Woody, Diane Keaton, and the ghost of Humphrey Bogart</h1>
